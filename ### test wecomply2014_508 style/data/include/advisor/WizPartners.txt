// PROGRAMS TO USE FOR EDITING THIS FILE
// *************************************
// This file must be saved as a .txt file, with Windows-type carriage returns (CR/LF).
// WINDOWS: Notepad is the best program to use. Microsoft Word may also be used, but when you're finished editing, the file must be saved as Text Only .txt (NOT Text Only with Line Breaks).
// MAC: TextEdit should NOT be used.  TextWrangler is a recommended shareware editor ( http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ ).

//
// *************************************
// SPECIAL CHARACTERS
// *************************************
// Certain reserved characters must be URL encoded.

// There may be other characters which need to be URL encoded. If you are running into problems, and you suspect a special character is the culprit, consult http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm for url encoding.
