During a crisis, it\'s imperative that unauthorized personnel refrain from speaking to the media.

The Company is committed to avoiding the release of inaccurate or speculative information.

The median amounts awarded in employment suits nationally rose steadily from under $175,000 in 2001 to almost $250,000 in 2003.</p></Body><Headline>Labor LitigationX Surge Puzzling</Headline><Subhead>Lawsuits and Damage Awards Are IncreasingX</Subhead></LinkBulletin></LinkBulletins><PopQuiz id="R40939" status="Published" width="500" height="400"><Introduction><p align="center">Kathleen McKenna is a partner in the Labor &amp; Employment Department of Proskauer Rose\'s New York office.</p><p style="font-size:8pt"><i><b>Please note:</b> You must allow the video to play to completion.

First, claims of sexual harassment, if they mature into lawsuits, are costly cases to litigate. And by cost, I\'m referring both to economic and non-economic costs of these lawsuits.</p> <p style="font-size:8pt">The economic costs are probably obvious to most of you. Plaintiffs who prevail in the litigation may be entitled to (1) actual damages &#8212; the loss of a promotion that they would have received but for the sexual harassment &#8212; that sort of thing; (2) compensatory damages for mental pain and suffering; (3) perhaps punitive damages that the jury might impose in order to punish the employer for the sexual harassment; and (4) attorney\'s fees &#8212; not only will you have to pay your attorney to defend you, but if the plaintiff prevails, you will have to pay the plaintiff\'s attorney\'s fees. But as we say, that\'s only money.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">There\'s also the non-economic costs of these kind of claims. Fundamentally, sexual harassment claims are reputational in nature. If there\'s a moment of my practice that I would give up in a minute, it is having to sit with someone who has been accused of sexual harassment. And in those moments, we talk about: How is the accused going to tell their spouse or their significant other that they\'ve been accused of sexual harassment? What if it becomes public? What are they going to say to their parents, their children, their neighbors, their co-workers? It is a gut-wrenching experience to be accused of any form of discrimination, but certainly sexual harassment &#8212; it\'s a sensitive and difficult subject to discuss. And thus, the best medicine is to avoid these claims\' coming up in the first place.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">Second, I should also say that the costs of these cases &#8212; the economic costs, the non-economic costs &#8212; are not those that just arise from statutory claims &#8212; an allegation that you have violated Title VII or state law by sexual harassment. But inevitably, these claims carry with them "tag-along" claims &#8212; claims of assault or battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress. So they become complicated cases to litigate. </p><p style="font-size:8pt">And last but not least, we need to take into account that these claims are not uncommon. Employees are less reluctant than they have ever been to talk about sexual conduct in the workplace. They know that sexual harassment is prohibited by law. The concept of sexual harassment is in the vernacular. When we can have a sitting President of the United States accused of sexual harassment, and his sexual behavior talked about in public, you can be sure that it makes employees less reluctant to talk about misconduct of a sexual nature that occurs in the workplace. And because employees are not reluctant anymore to talk about these claims, we see them with increasing frequency.</p><br /><br /></Transcript></Video></PopQuiz></Chapter>',

The women claimed that they were subjected to insults such as being called "whores," "bitches" and "sluts," being coerced to have sex, having male supervisors and assembly-line workers grabbing at their bodies, and being exposed to explicit drawings and notes on bathroom walls about women who allegedly engaged in sex with male co-workers.  If Mitsubishi had lost the suit, it was estimated that the company could have been liable for as much as $200 million in damages, which would have been the largest payout by an employer in a sexual harassment suit.  Rather than risk such a large judgment, Mitsubishi settled the claims for $34 million.</li><li>In May 2001, Trans World Airlines agreed to</li></ul></blockquote>pay $2.6 million to settle claims of sexual harassment and retaliation brought by a group of women who worked for the airline.

Does Suzy have a viable claim of sexual harassment?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>No, the co-worker\'s actions do not amount to harassment, let alone sexual harassment.</Body><Feedback>Twisting arms and blocking doorways are definitely forms of harassment and could be sexual harassment, depending on the circumstances.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>No, the co-worker may have violated other company policies, but he is not guilty of sexual harassment because Adam was not interested in having sex with the women.</Body><Feedback>Sexual harassment does not necessarily involve overt sexual conduct.

Now her manager repeatedly asks her if she\'s feeling okay, tells her to rest, and has transferred her most challenging job duties to a co-worker. This morning, after he saw Anita stifle several yawns during a long meeting, her manager told her that it was clear that her pregnancy was making her too tired to be working and that she must take time off until she\'s able to return to work after having the baby. Did Anita\'s manager violate any laws?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>No, he was just being overly protective.</Body><Feedback>Anita\'s manager may have had the best of intentions, but it was not up to him to decide what was best for Anita and her baby. As long as Anita was willing and able to perform her regular job duties and there was no evidence that her performance had declined, her manager had no legal basis for his actions.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>Yes. He violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by not accommodating her disability (pregnancy).</Body><Feedback>While the Americans with Disabilities Act does require employers to reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with known disabilities, Anita\'s pregnancy did not make her disabled.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="true"><Body>Yes. He violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act by changing her terms and conditions of employment and forcing her to take leave because she was pregnant.</Body><Feedback>The Pregnancy Discrimination Act is an amendment to the sex-discrimination prohibition of Title VII. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions. By assuming that Anita could not do her job, relieving her of job duties and forcing her to take leave, her manager probably violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Unless Anita was truly unable to perform her job, her manager had no basis for assuming that her pregnancy prevented her from working or that her working would harm her baby; such stereotypes are the very reason the Act was enacted.</Feedback></Choice></Choices></QuizQuestion></QuizQuestions><PopQuiz id="R41720" status="Published" width="500" height="400"><Introduction><p align="center">Hal Brody is a partner in the Labor &amp; Employment Department of Proskauer Rose\'s Los Angeles office.</p><p style="font-size:8pt"><i><b>Please note:</b> You must allow the video to play to completion.

State law is set forth in the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, which we almost always refer to as "FEHA." Those of us who practice in California almost never see federal claims anymore. Why?  Because FEHA provides all the remedies that the federal law does and more. It allows the employee more time to file a claim, it has a longer statute of limitations, and the biggest difference between the two are the differences in the damages.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">Under federal law, a plaintiff who prevails in a sexual harassment claim is entitled to recover his or her economic damages &#8212; the back pay and the front pay &#8212; and compensatory damages &#8212; that is, an award for emotional pain and suffering and in some instances punitive damages against the employer. But under federal law, there is a cap on the amount a plaintiff can recover for such compensatory damages that\'s tied to the size of the employer\'s workplace.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">Not so under state law. Under state law an employee can recover all the same economic damages, but when it comes to compensatory damages, that is, the emotional pain and suffering &#8212; when it comes to punitive damages, that is, damages that are awarded in addition to pain and suffering damages to ensure that the employer never does this again &#8212; our law imposes absolutely no cap on those damages.  And the result is that in California, six- and oftentimes seven-figure awards are not at all uncommon in these cases. So the stakes are very high.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">Plus, another important difference is, our law says that anybody &#8212; a supervisor, an employee &#8212; who is personally liable for having engaged in sexual harassment is personally answerable in damages. That is, you as a supervisor, you as a co-employee, can have a judgment entered against you for whatever amount the jury thinks is appropriate on account of your sexual harassment.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">Another area in which our law and federal law differ is this: Under California law, an employer is <i>strictly liable</i> for the acts of sexual harassment that are committed by its supervisors. The law is somewhat different under the federal system, but in the state system, under our state law, your company, your employer is strictly liable if you have engaged in sexual harassment.</p> <p style="font-size:8pt">Another area in which our law is different &#8212; differ I should say &#8212; is the defenses that are available. Under the federal law, following a couple of U.S. Supreme Court cases called <i>Faragher</i> and <i>Ellerth</i>, there are certain circumstances in which an employee who alleges she\'s been sexually harassed but has suffered no tangible workplace harm and has worked in a workplace in which the employer can show that it was diligent and effective in promulgating an anti-harassment policy, in such an instance such an employer might be able to escape liability entirely.  Our own Supreme Court considered that issue a year or two ago and said that it didn\'t work under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, that there was no such complete defense, because as I said a moment ago, under our law supervisors are strictly liable for acts of sexual harassment.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">So while our Supreme Court says there\'s not a complete defense, there is something called "avoidable consequences." That is, the employer can affirmatively attempt to prove that, had the employee made use of the sexual harassment complaint procedure that was available to her, she in fact would not have suffered damages she did, or would have suffered far less in the way of damages than what she now claims to have suffered. But for that defense to work, the employer must affirmatively come forward and demonstrate that its policy had consistently and effectively been enforced.<br/><br/></p></Transcript></Video></PopQuiz></Chapter>',

Lorna is not the least bit interested in Al and has let him know this, but he continues to ask her out and touch her on the arm when he talks to her. Does Lorna have a claim for sexual harassment?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>No, because Al\'s flirting is relatively harmless and is not unlawful harassment.</Body><Feedback>Although Al may think that his conduct is harmless, it could be considered harassment if it was severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment for Lorna.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>No, because even if Al\'s conduct could be considered sexual harassment, it occurred outside of the workplace.</Body><Feedback>Gatherings of employees outside of the workplace may be considered an extension of the workplace for harassment purposes.

The newest manager, Adam Easton, an African-American, was invited to attend the next convention, but he returned from the preliminary planning meeting upset. It seems that the other managers, none of whom is black, won\'t share a hotel room with him. Unfortunately, the company cannot afford the expense of allowing him to stay in a room alone.

What should the company do?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>Deny Adam the opportunity to go to the conference if he has no one to share a room with.</Body><Feedback>Denying Adam the opportunity to attend a conference that he is otherwise eligible to attend will be seen for what it likely is &#8212; punishment for Adam\'s being black. The company may not merely accept the situation as is. The company has a responsibility to investigate and stop any racial discrimination it knows or should know about.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="true"><Body>Initiate training sessions for the managerial staff.</Body><Feedback>The managers should be educated on the federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination in the workplace.

An investigation into the facts should be made first. Perhaps there are other reasons why Adam was shunned, and Adam\'s race truly had no role in the other managers\' behavior.

All such conflicts should be avoided. The Company demands absolute integrity from all its employees and will not tolerate any conduct that falls short of that standard. The Company expects that no employee will knowingly place himself or herself in a position that would have the appearance of being, or could be construed to be, in conflict with the interests of the Company. Some of the more sensitive areas of conflicts of interest and the Company\'s related guidelines are as follows:</p><ol><li><h3>Accepting Gifts and Entertainment</h3><p>The Company\'s aim is to deter givers of gifts from seeking or receiving special favors from Company employees. (For guidelines concerning the giving of gifts to, or entertainment of, customers and others by Company employees, employees are referred to the Bribery, Kickback and Fraud section.) Accepting any gift of more than nominal value or entertainment that is more than a routine social amenity can appear to be an attempt to influence the recipient into favoring a particular customer, vendor, consultant or the like. To avoid the reality and the appearance of improper relations with current or prospective customers, vendors and consultants, employees should observe the following guidelines when deciding whether or not to accept gifts or entertainment:</p><ol type=\"a\"><li><u>Gifts</u><p>Gifts such as merchandise or products, as well as personal services or favors may not be accepted unless they have a value of less than $50. This dollar limit is intended to serve as a guideline, and employees are urged to consult with the Compliance Officer before accepting any gifts of more than nominal value. Gifts of any amount may never be solicited. A gift of cash or securities may never be accepted.</p><p>In some international business transactions, it is customary and lawful for business leaders in a host country to give gifts to Company employees. These gifts may be of more than nominal value and under the circumstances returning the gifts or paying for them may be an affront to the giver. In such a situation, the gift must be reported to the employee\'s supervisor. In all other instances where gifts cannot be returned and offering to pay for them would adversely affect continuing business relationships, supervisors must be notified. In some cases, the gift may be retained by the Company, at its sole discretion, and not the individual.</p></li><li><u>Entertainment</u><p>Normal business entertainment such as lunch, dinner, theater, a sporting event, and the like, is appropriate if of a reasonable nature and in the course of a meeting or another occasion, the purpose of which is to hold bona fide business discussions or to foster better business relations. All such entertainment should be reported (in advance, if practical) by the employee to his or her supervisor. No employee may accept tickets or invitations to entertainment when the prospective host will not be present at the event with the employee. Where entertainment offered in a foreign country does not fit these norms, exceptions must be cleared with the Compliance Officer, the head of Human Resources or the Chief Operating Officer of the Company.</p></li></ol></li><li><h3>Outside Activities</h3><p>It is the policy of the Company that no employee is to have a \"free-lance\" or \"moonlighting\" activity that will materially encroach on the time or attention which should be devoted to the employee\'s duties; adversely affect the quality of work performed; compete with the Company\'s activities; imply sponsorship or support by the Company of the outside employment or organization; or adversely affect the good name of the Company. All free-lance or moonlighting activities require the prior written approval of the employee\'s supervisor. Employees who free-lance or moonlight may not use Company time, facilities, resources, or supplies for such work.</p></li><li><h3>Interests in Other Businesses</h3><p>Unless approved in advance by an employee\'s supervisor, neither an employee nor his or her spouse, domestic partner, or any other member of the employee\'s immediate family may directly or indirectly have a financial interest (whether as an investor, lender, employee or other service provider) in a competitor, or in a customer or supplier if that employee or his or her subordinates deal directly or indirectly with or would take actions that favor that customer or supplier in the course of his or her job with the Company.</p></li></ol></Body></LinkBulletin><LinkBulletin id="R36827" status="CheckedOut" variety="News" width="386" height="504" s="false" ordinal="1"><Name>N209: Peepholes Point to Impropriety</Name><Body><p>A federal judge has upheld the $275,000 jury award to a former waitress at Hooters, a restaurant chain, in a sexual harassment suit. The plaintiff claimed that she found peepholes in a dressing room that was adjacent to an employee break room.

Absent a tangible employment action, the employer may assert an affirmative defense to a claim of unlawful harassment if it acted reasonably to prevent or correct harassing behavior.The individual supervisor is liable for any harassment he or she perpetrates, regardless of whether the employer knew or should have known of the conduct or took immediate and appropriate corrective action.</p><p>A California employer is not liable for harassment by a coworker, nonsupervisory employee or third-party unless it knows or should know of the conduct and fails to act <i>reasonably</i> in responding to the employee\'s complaint.

One day, Ashley spoke up, telling the biggest loudmouth that she found his banter offensive. The next time she entered the cafeteria, the loudmouth announced, "Here comes the Gestapo. Let\'s go over in the corner so I can tell you one I heard yesterday..." Which of the following statements is the most accurate?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect="true"><Body>The employees\' behavior may have created a hostile work environment, and Ashley should report it.</Body><Feedback>The cumulative impact of ongoing racist "humor" supports a claim by Ashley of a racially hostile work environment. The loudmouth has not improved the situation by moving out of earshot.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>The employees\' behavior may have created a hostile work environment, but Ashley has no complaint because she tolerated it for so long.</Body><Feedback>The fact that Ashley voiced no previous objections to the racist "humor" does not forfeit her right to complain now.

Ashley has a right to try and make her work environment more comfortable and free from harassment at any time.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>The loudmouth has honored Ashley\'s wishes and separated from her, so Ashley has no complaint.</Body><Feedback>Telling racist jokes is inappropriate anywhere in the workplace, regardless of who is within earshot.</Feedback></Choice></Choices></QuizQuestion><QuizQuestion id="R2153" status="Published" width="360" height="200"><Body>Every day during her lunch hour, Office Manager Anne Henderson sits at her desk, reading newspapers and ranting "to herself" about the state of the world, peppering her remarks with ethnic slurs aimed at Asians and people from the Middle East.

Thus, if an employee has a complaint about sexual harassment, the employee should follow the procedures provided for in the employer\'s established harassment policy.

And the elements of each are different and can be proved in a different way in front of a jury.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">Probably the most common form of sexual harassment that everyone\'s heard of is what is referred to in the law as quid pro quo. And what that means is basically that something has been given by the employer or the supervisor in exchange for sexual favors. That\'s the statement of what you would find quid pro quo sexual harassment to be in its crudest form. I think that that probably is also the least common sexual harassment that we see these days in lawsuits that are filed every day in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California. Most employers, I think, at this point have come to the realization that overt acts, overt exchanges of favors in the workplace for sexual favors, are illegal and are inappropriate and immoral, and just generally don\'t exist as much as they perhaps once did. Not to say they don\'t exist at all, but they\'re less common.</p> <p style="font-size:8pt">The kinds of cases that we see much more frequently today are cases that are known as hostile environment claims. And those involve situations in which a number of different things have occurred in the workplace that an employee can seize upon in the context of litigation and knit together for purposes of a complaint and say that all of these various actors, all of these various actions that occurred in the workplace combined to create a hostile environment.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">And so what you have are situations in which employees will look at or plaintiffs\' lawyers will be looking at, situations involving, for example, visual depictions, graphics, pictures, things that come up on a computer, web sites, or anything that might be printed from a website, for example, that come in to the workplace and that employees will claim in some way or another created a hostile environment. In addition to visual depictions, you can have situations where there are jokes being told, stories that are being recounted, you might have posters on the wall, for example. All these things together, although they may not come from a single source, combine to create an environment that an employee can claim was hostile.</p> <p style="font-size:8pt">In an effort to try an assist you in identifying what could be potentially a hostile environment, we\'ve created something that we call "the liability zone." And what that basically does is show you the two factors that the courts look to, and the juries will look to in trying to determine whether or not there is liability on the part of a company, or indeed liability on the part of an individual supervisor or co-worker. You\'re looking now at the liability zone chart. And as you see on the vertical axis, we have the word "pervasiveness." Not a very common term, but one that the courts look at. What that means is the multiplicity, the number of times that something has occurred. On the horizontal line, we\'ve got "severity." and that\'s just the level of seriousness (severity) that any given action or series of actions may have had.</p><p style="font-size:8pt">So if you look anywhere within what we\'ve termed here "the liability zone," there is potential problems for the employer because of the pervasiveness or the severity. So, in essence, this graph shows that the less serious the action, the more instances there would have to be for there to be a liability. The more serious the action, the fewer instances there would have to be in order to be a liability.<br/><br/></p></Transcript></Video></PopQuiz></Chapter>',

Therefore, you should keep in mind that simply because certain misconduct may not rise to the level of legally actionable harassment, this does not mean that it is permitted in our workplace. Our <a href="term:1">Policy</a> prohibits a broader range of conduct than might be prohibited by the law. Accordingly, <a href="http://www.michaeljlee.net">employees</a> may be disciplined at our Company for conduct that is not actually unlawful in order to make our workplace a more comfortable place to work.</p></Discussion><Illustration id="R184" status="Published" src="media-184.gif" variety="image/gif" height="275" width="140"></Illustration><Terms><Term id="R19543" status="Published" variety="Standard" ordinal="1" width="620" height="500" allowPrint="false"><Name>Policy</Name><Definition><h2>Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy</h2><p>The XYZ Company is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and prohibits discriminatory practices, including harassment. Therefore, XYZ expects that all relationships among persons in the workplace will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice and harassment.</p><h3>Equal Employment Opportunity</h3><p>It is the policy of XYZ to ensure equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (with or without sexual conduct), age, disability, [alienage or citizenship status, marital status, creed, genetic predisposition or carrier status, sexual orientation] or any other characteristic protected by law. XYZ prohibits and will not tolerate any such discrimination or harassment.</p><h3>Definitions of Harassment</h3><ol><li><b>Sexual harassment</b> constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal, state and local laws. For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined, as in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when, for example: (i) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\'s employment; (ii) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or (iii) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\'s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.<br/><br/>Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include, but are not limited to: unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendo; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual\'s body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, catcalls or touching; insulting or obscene comments or gestures; display or circulation in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures (including through e-mail); and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature. Sex-based harassment â€” that is, harassment not involving sexual activity or language (e.g., male manager yells only at female employees and not males) â€” may also constitute discrimination if it is severe or pervasive and directed at employees because of their sex.</li><li><b>Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic</b> is also strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, [alienage or citizenship status, marital status, creed, genetic predisposition or carrier status, sexual orientation] or any other characteristic protected by law or that of his/her relatives, friends or associates, and that: (i) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; (ii) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\'s work performance; or (iii) otherwise adversely affects an individual\'s employment opportunities.<br/><br/>Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation in the workplace of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group (including through e-mail).</li></ol><h3>Individuals and Conduct Covered</h3><p>These policies apply to all applicants and employees, and prohibit harassment, discrimination and retaliation whether engaged in by fellow employees, by a supervisor or manager or by someone not directly connected to XYZ (e.g., an outside vendor, consultant or customer).</p><p>Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings and business-related social events.</p><h3>Retaliation Is Prohibited</h3><p>XYZ prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment or participates in an investigation of such reports. Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination or for participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject to disciplinary action.</p></Definition></Term></Terms><MatchGame id="R15024" status="Published" ><Heading>Code of Conduct Match</Heading><Introduction>In the boxes above are questions that can arise in the workplace.

It consists of unwelcome sexual conduct that has the purpose or effect of (1) unreasonably interfering with the victim\'s work performance, or (2) creating a work environment that is hostile, offensive or threatening.</p><h4>Example:</h4><blockquote style="width:100%">One of the salesmen is always ogling Patti, an executive secretary. The salesman makes suggestive comments to Patti about her clothes and sends her sexually explicit jokes by e-mail â€” even after Patti asked him to stop. He still asks her out at least once a week, no matter how forcefully Patti says no.<br/><br/></blockquote><p>As discussed in the sections that follow, conduct will be considered to have created a hostile work environment if it is:</p><ol><li>Based on the victim\'s gender or other protected characteristic;</li><li>Offensive from both an objective (offensive to a reasonable person) and subjective (offensive to the person who complains) perspective;</li><li>Sufficiently <i>severe</i> or <i>pervasive</i> to alter the conditions of the victim\'s employment and create an abusive environment; and</li><li>Unwelcome.</li></ol></Discussion><Illustration id="R217" status="Published" src="media-217.gif" variety="image/gif" height="209" width="220"></Illustration><LinkBulletins><LinkBulletin id="R26732" status="Published" variety="News" width="386" height="340" allowPrint="false" ordinal="1"><Name>Juno Served with $10M Sex Suit</Name><Body><p>A former employee filed a $10 million sexual harassment claim against former Internet giant Juno Online. The plaintiff contended that a hostile environment was advanced by a function called "Happy Hour," a weekly drinking session that employees were encouraged to attend.  The plaintiff alleged that the gathering was "a meat market where most of the men at Juno would make sexual remarks and try to enter into sexual relationships with the females." According to the plaintiff, her numerous reports to Human Resources were repeatedly ignored.</p></Body><Illustration id="R19322" status="Published" src="media-19322.gif" variety="image/gif" height="82" width="360"></Illustration><Headline>Juno Served with $10M Sex Suit</Headline><Subhead>Ex-Employee Alleges Happy Hour &quot;Meat Market&quot;</Subhead></LinkBulletin></LinkBulletins><PopQuiz id="R19302" status="Published" width="500" height="400"><Introduction>In the following vignette, Bill and Alison are co-workers in the Sales Department.

Inappropriate touching or leering and staring at someone\'s body, as Bill did, can contribute to a hostile work environment and violates company policy. Here, Bill\'s wandering glances also colored his description of the project as requiring &quot;late nights,&quot; and his desire to have Alison on his &quot;team&quot; suggested that he was seeking more than just work-related support. All in all, Bill\'s conduct could give rise to a claim of sexual harassment. </Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="false"><Body>No, because Alison didn\'t tell Bill that his behavior was unwelcome. </Body><Feedback>While it is true that sexually-suggestive behavior is not unlawful if it is welcome, Alison did not in any way suggest that she welcomed Bill\'s overt attempt to look down her blouse or his accompanying references to &quot;late nights.&quot; Bill\'s conduct was clearly inappropriate and could give rise to a claim of sexual harassment.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect="true"><Body>Yes, because Bill was leering at Alison and attempted to look down her dress.</Body><Feedback>When an employee\'s stares, ogles and leers are unwelcome by the recipient, that behavior is a violation of company policy and could contribute to a hostile work environment. In this case, Bill clearly tried to look down Alison\'s blouse and accompanied this behavior by not-so-subtle talk of &quot;late nights.&quot; Alison gave no indication that this behavior was welcome. </Feedback></Choice></Choices></PopQuizQuestion></PopQuizQuestions><Video id="R19303" status="Published" src="media-19063.flv" variety="video/x-flv" height="156" width="240"><Transcript><table cellspacing="8" style="font-size:8pt"><tr><td valign="top" width="72" align="right"><i>Alison:</i></td><td valign="top">The ARs for January look good.
