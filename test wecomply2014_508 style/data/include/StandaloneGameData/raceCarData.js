The news was to be announced on April 3. Doris had been planning to buy more XYZ stock anyway, so she did so on April 2. Was this a problem? </Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"true\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because Doris knew about the earnings report.</Body><Feedback>Doris knew about the earnings report when she purchased the stock. The fact that she had planned to buy the stock would not protect her from liability.
