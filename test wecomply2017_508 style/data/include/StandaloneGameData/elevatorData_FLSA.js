To cover the costs of the background check, XYZ deducted the fee from Nicole\'s first paycheck. Was this okay?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"true\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, as long as it did not reduce her pay below the minimum wage.</Body><Feedback>There is nothing in the FLSA that absolutely prohibits deductions from an employee\'s paycheck, but these deductions may not decrease the employee\'s earnings below the minimum wage.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because XYZ had a right to recover these expenses from its employees.</Body><Feedback>While true, this fact alone does not make XYZ\'s practice legal.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>No, because Nicole is an unskilled worker.</Body><Feedback>The FLSA does not have a requirement prohibiting deductions for unskilled workers.</Feedback></Choice></Choices></QuizQuestion><QuizQuestion id=\"R138139\" status=\"Published\" variety=\"MultipleChoiceOneAnswer\" width=\"360\" height=\"200\"><Body>Lan entered customer information into XYZ Inc.\'s computer system, earning $9 for each new customer she added. She worked 40 hours per week, and she usually earned at least $400 weekly. Was she being paid enough under the FLSA?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because the FLSA sets no minimum wage.</Body><Feedback>The FLSA does establish a minimum rate for piece work.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"true\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because her rate of pay is equivalent to at least minimum wage.</Body><Feedback>Even employees who are paid by the piece must earn a wage that is equal to the minimum hourly wage. If Lan works 40 hours per week and earns $400, she is earning the equivalent of $10 per hour, which is more than the minimum wage required. Remember, though, that some states may require a higher minimum wage.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because $9 is more than the current minimum wage.</Body><Feedback>The FLSA requires that employees be paid at least the minimum hourly wage. Since Lan is paid for each new customer added, called a \"piece rate,\" her earnings per week must be equal to or greater than the minimum wage.</Feedback></Choice></Choices></QuizQuestion><QuizQuestion id=\"R138140\" status=\"Published\" variety=\"MultipleChoiceOneAnswer\" width=\"360\" height=\"200\"><Body>XYZ Inc. considered hiring some one-armed workers, but it knew that the one-armed workers would not be as fast and productive as two-armed co-workers.

He clocked out everyday at 3 p.m., but he stayed on-site for an extra half-hour to clean the machines he used in his job. Could XYZ owe him overtime?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"true\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because he was performing a work-related activity. </Body><Feedback>Although Eli had already clocked out and did not immediately ask for overtime, XYZ still may have to pay him overtime for hours worked over 40. </Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>No, because Eli should have cleaned his tools before 3 p.m.</Body><Feedback>Perhaps, but this would not necessarily mean that he is not entitled to overtime.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>No, because Eli had already clocked out.</Body><Feedback>This is not a deciding factor.</Feedback></Choice></Choices></QuizQuestion><QuizQuestion id=\"R138142\" status=\"Published\" variety=\"MultipleChoiceOneAnswer\" width=\"360\" height=\"200\"><Body>Phil stayed late Friday night to catch up on some filing, but he did not get approval for the overtime. On Monday morning, Isabel, his supervisor, informed him that he would not be paid overtime because it had not been approved. Can Isabel do this?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"true\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>No, because Phil worked more than 40 hours for the week.</Body><Feedback>Although Isabel may be able to discipline Phil for not getting approval, she must still pay him time-and-a-half for the extra hours he worked over 40.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because he didn\'t get approval to work overtime.</Body><Feedback>The FLSA requires employers to pay overtime, even if an employee didn\'t request it in advance.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, as long as she pays him his regular rate of pay for his first 40 hours of work that week.</Body><Feedback>The FLSA requires employers to pay time-and-a-half for the hours worked over 40, even if the employee didn\'t request it in advance.</Feedback></Choice></Choices></QuizQuestion><QuizQuestion id=\"R138143\" status=\"Published\" variety=\"MultipleChoiceOneAnswer\" width=\"360\" height=\"200\"><Body>Jamie asked his assistant Melissa to stay late one night, but the had already worked a full 40 hours that week. Jamie said, \"You can take off an hour next month for each extra hour you work tonight.\" Is this arrangement okay?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because Melissa is being compensated with extra time off.</Body><Feedback>The FLSA permits \"comp time\" in very limited circumstances. Moreover, compensating Melissa one hour of time off for one hour of work is problematic because it is unlikely to be equivalent to the time-and-a-half pay she would be entitled to for hours worked over 40.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, because Melissa is an administrative worker and is ineligible for overtime.</Body><Feedback>Just because Melissa\'s work is characterized as \"administrative\" does not exempt XYZ Inc. from paying her overtime.

Was he entitled to overtime pay under the FLSA?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"true\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Probably not, since he worked in sales.</Body><Feedback>Keith appears to be an outside salesperson and was likely exempt from the minimum-wage and hour requirements of the FLSA.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>No, because of his salary.</Body><Feedback>An employee\'s annual earnings alone are usually not important in deciding his/her entitlement to overtime pay.</Feedback></Choice><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>Yes, if his employer\'s income exceeded $500,000.</Body><Feedback>Even though an employer does a sufficient volume of business and is required to be in compliance with the FLSA, it may not be required to pay all of its employees overtime or minimum wage.</Feedback></Choice></Choices></QuizQuestion></QuizQuestions><QuizQuestions><QuizQuestion id=\"R138194\" status=\"Published\" variety=\"MultipleChoiceOneAnswer\" width=\"360\" height=\"200\"><Body>XYZ Inc. hired Gina to assemble mailings and signed a contract that referred to her as an independent contractor. She worked from home and was paid a salary of $300 per week as long as she met her quota. Is Gina entitled to overtime?</Body><Choices><Choice isCorrect=\"false\" hasTextInput=\"false\"><Body>No, because she signed the contract.</Body><Feedback>An employment contract that gives a worker the title of \"independent contractor\" does not mean that he/she is automatically exempt from the FLSA.
